Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

My client was DriverPass and they wanted us to build a website that allowed their customers to take practice exams and make reservations with our instructors.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did well in listing the nontechnical and technical requirements, as well as understanding our client's objectives and goals. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Nothing specific, but overall I believe I could have reduce the amount of redundancy in my answers. It felt like some of the ideas and points I had fitted multiple categories and 
so I place it there as well.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are important because they the people who will be interacting with the system and my streamlining the process and use cases, it makes their lives easier
as well as more secure. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
First we should establish the objective and goals. Sometimes ideas can be vague and we have to sit down and really think about the requirements to make our clients happy. It may also be possible
that the ideas are not grounded in reality and we would have to determine flexibility. We can start to categorize the different ideas and see which are the most important pieces that will fulfill our goal.
